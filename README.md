This repository contains the main analysis conducted as part of my MSc Project, including:
- Final Code Used to Train the Neural Network to obtain weights and biases used in Isca
  (https://github.com/19318676/mscproject/tree/main/Final_NN_used_in_Isca) and
- Notebooks in which main figures and results were produced for:
    - Frierson Replication and Earth-Like Isca Simulations
      (https://github.com/19318676/mscproject/blob/main/Plotting_Isca_Results/FriersonPlots.ipynb)
    - Machine Learning Isca Simulations
      (https://github.com/19318676/mscproject/blob/main/Plotting_Isca_Results/Code_to_produce_results.ipynb) using functions.py module.
